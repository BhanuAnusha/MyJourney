ðŸš€ Vulnerability Analyst | Wipro
July 2019 - March 2021
Embarked on an exhilarating tech adventure with Wipro right out of college, spearheading a small, dynamic team dedicated to ironing out digital creases and buffing up cybersecurity measures.

ðŸŒŸ Notable Achievements:

I was quick to take on the responsibility of supervising a team of two, focusing on training and managing daily tasks. My initial role evolved significantly as I introduced innovative automation solutions to our clients. These initiatives dramatically reduced manual efforts required for vulnerability remediation on customer servers by 80%, showcasing the potential of automation in enhancing cybersecurity measures.

Each week, I conducted comprehensive vulnerability scans using Nessus to detect high-severity vulnerabilities across client servers. I meticulously analyzed these scan reports and coordinated with the internal security team to ensure timely and effective remediation. My efforts led to an improved efficiency rate in our weekly scans, directly contributing to better security practices and compliance with industry standards.

This position allowed me to develop a deep understanding of identifying and addressing systemic weaknesses within client environments, which proved crucial in securing and optimizing their digital infrastructure.
